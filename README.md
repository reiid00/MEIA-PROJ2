# MEIA-PROJ2: Inventory Optimization and Revenue Forecasting for Retail Stores

This project aims to optimize in-stock inventory and maximize revenue in retail stores using machine learning models, planning algorithms, and decision-making techniques. The study involved pre-processing a dataset containing company purchases and sales information to improve data quality, followed by the development and optimization of a machine learning model to accurately predict sales and revenue. The time-series data was transformed using difference transformation, which improved the model's performance. Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) were used to determine optimal product stock quantities based on predicted sales and revenue, while considering constraints such as minimum and maximum product quantities, store dimensions, and product variety. A comparison of both algorithms was conducted to assess their effectiveness in solving the planning problem.
